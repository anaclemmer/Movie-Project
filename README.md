**Data Science Final Project**

Given a movie dataset, analyzed data and used machine learning to predict success of movie entries. 

Skills practiced in this project:
1. Data loading
2. Data cleaning (mean imputation, formatting, accuracy)
4. Data exploration (hypothesis testing, contingency analysis, sentiment analysis, covariance)
5. Data visualization (box plot, line graph)
6. Feature engineering (numerical encoding)
7. Machine learning (modeling- random forest, testing, feature importance)
